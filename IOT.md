# Internet of Things

`Everything has an IP address, but what can you do with that?`

# Basics

- Location
- Turn normal objects into SMART objects utilizing ML, sensors, mobile devices.
- LOTS of devices getting IP addresses. No. Items? 2^128 devices.
- 1% of the physical world is connected to the internet
- Huge potential, innovative business, increase efficiency
- Smart cities

# Example of IOT?

- Using cameras to analyze traffice, learn distribution and stop traffice jams 
- Cameras to count number of students in class
- So many examples..

# What actually is IOT

- Add sensors to physical systems and add an IP address
- Form a network of physical objects
- Forms back to 1982.. Carnegie Mellon connected coke machine to the internet

# What are Cyber-Physical System (CPS)

- Embedding sensors into physical devices. Normal things
- Think of buildings, thermostats, homes, etc. Making normal objects SMART in the web.

# Challenges of Cyber Physical Systems?

- Systems are extremely large and each component is dynamic
    . How many sensors to use, what data to collect, etc.
- Need to work with multi-discplinary groups to understand problems better
    . Doctors don't know code, Coders don't know medical. They need to work together
    . Example: Coders make pacemaker. They need to understand tissue growing over the device. They work with doctors to get this information.
- What is human-in-the-loop?
    . Models that require human interacton
- You have entities with magnitude of difference on capabilities
    . Sensors, medical devices, servers, computing devices, humans, etc.

# Key Issues with IOT

- Physical Interactions
- Critical Applications (Think airplanes, hospitals, ambulance, police cars, etc)
- Automated Design and Validation

# Applications for IOT

- Media
- Environmental monitoring
- Energy management
- Medical devices
- Transit
- Home automation

# What is the "Smart Grid"

- Using some machine learning to detect and react to local changes in usage
- SRP changes amount of electrical current sent to a homeowner based on distribution of usage over time to save everyone money
- Integrate energy harvesting sources (See below) to increase the "Smart Grid"
- SRP essentially uses your day to conduct a smart amount of electricity to you as a homeowner
    . Requires sensors and company access to all your data
    . Uses some smart algorithms to determine suitable hours for electricity amounts
- Nobody does this these days because solar panel is not super reliable
    . Cloud cover, rain, etc. Reduces amount of generated energy

# What is Energy Harvesting?

- Converting natural sources of power to forms of electrcity
- Thing about wind fans on the way to california
- No carbon footprint, safe, powerful
- Another example is through the use of solar panels
